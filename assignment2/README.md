Helpful notes for completing assignment 2

Task 3: 
    - The mathematical methods only need implementations for arrays containing ints and floats.
    - The r-mathematical methods simply call their corresponding methods.
    - Fix all the mathematical methods. They return something of type Array! They do not change the original Array.
    - Raise an informative ValueError instead of returning NotImplemented for arithmetic methods with arrays of mismatched shapes.
    - Fix all mathematical methods so that they also check scalar values for type matching the array type.
