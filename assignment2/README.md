Helpful notes for completing assignment 2

Task 3: 
    - Fix boolean tests for the 1d unit tests in add, sub and mul.
    - Fix pytest so you can run all the tests, fix every mistake, and begin on 2d arrays.
    - The *variables argument in Array __init__ has an asterisk which tells python it is a so-called variadic function.
      Variadic functions take an indefinite amount of arguments, no limit. To pass a varaidic argument in a function call using
      a list, use the asterisk here aswell. Array((5,1), *list) will treat the list not as an element, but the elements inside as elements.
    - The type() function does NOT return a string of the type, rather the type itself.
